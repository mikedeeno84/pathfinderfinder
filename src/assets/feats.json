      " Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity&apos;s alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric&apos;s deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don&apos;t reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the <i>detect alignment</i> spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn&apos;t exist.",
      " To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante. You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don&apos;t have either trait regardless of your current identity."

When you successfully use Battle Medicine, you can also reduce the target&apos;s sickened, enfeebled, or clumsy condition by 1 (this has no effect if you are subject to an effect continually applying the clumsy condition, like <i>enlarge</i>). If you are legendary in Medicine, you can choose to reduce the target&apos;s frightened or stunned condition by 1 instead, and if you have the Godless Healing feat, you can choose to reduce the target&apos;s stupefied or drained condition by 1 instead. If you have the Mortal Healing feat, you can reduce all available conditions by 1 for a target who hasn&apos;t benefited from positive or healing magic in the last 24 hours, and if you roll a critical success before applying the effects of the feat, you reduce all available conditions by 2 for that target instead.\n"
